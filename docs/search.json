This means that I use mass spectrometry-based techniques to understand the chemical structure of proteins in the pharmaceutical industry.\nMy PhD and Postdoctoral training was focused on using high-resolution mass spectrometry to address structural, biochemical, and biological questions.\nI’m also a self-taught data scientist. This came out of a necessity to understand and interpret the large data generated by mass spectrometry-based proteomics.\nOutside the lab, I love to spend time with my family and enjoy a backyard barbeque.\n\n\n\nInterests\n\nMass Spectrometry\nProteomics\nData Analysis in R\nReproducible Research\nBBQ\n\n\n\n\nEducation\n\nPhD in Biomolecular Chemistry - University of Wisconsin-Madison\nBS in Biology - University of Texas Permian Basin"
