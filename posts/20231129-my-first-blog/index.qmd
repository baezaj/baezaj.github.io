I've always been talkig about starting a blog. Well I finally sat down to figure it out. I followed much of the information found in this [post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)


Now to include some executable code...

```{r setup}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)


```

```{r}
#| label: Iris data
#| code-fold: true

iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  coord_fixed()


```
