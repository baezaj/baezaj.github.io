For the past two years, I've been talking about starting a personal wesbite. This past week, I finally did by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN75YXaLFGM)

To add a blog to the new website, I followed much of the information found in this [post](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/)

Voila, a new website. 

Now to include some executable code...

```{r setup}
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
#| label: Iris data
#| code-fold: true

iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic(base_size = 18) +
  coord_fixed()


```
