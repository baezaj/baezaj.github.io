# About me

I'm an analytical biochemist working in biopharm drug development. This means that I use mass spectrometry-based techniques to understand the chemical structure of proteins in the pharmaceutical industry. 

My PhD and Postdoctoral training was focused on using high-resolution mass spectrometry to address structural, biochemical, and biological questions. 

I'm also a self-taught data scientist. This came out of a necessity to understand and interpret the large data generated by mass spectrometry-based [proteomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics). 

Outside the lab, I love to spend time with my family and enjoy a backyard barbeque.
